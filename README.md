# smart-college-canteen-app
A mobile-based food ordering and tracking application for college canteens.

This project aims to reduce waiting time and crowd in college canteens by enabling users to
browse menus, place food orders, make payments, and track order status using a mobile application.

The system supports multiple colleges and canteens with role-based access for users,
canteen administrators, and head administrators.
